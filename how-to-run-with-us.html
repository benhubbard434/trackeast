<h1 class="orange-highlight">How to run with us</h1>
<p>At Track East, our mission is to make track as accessible to as many runners as possible. We're free to join, and we don't charge membership or session fees. That being said, to enter Mile End track where we run each week, Better Gyms charge a small fee.</p>

<p>We run every Thursday at Mile End, with the session starting at 7pm. We're open to everyone, but we do ask that you can comfortably run 5k (at whatever pace you like). Our sessions have pace groups suitable for all different paces.</p>

<h4 class="orange-highlight">Step one</h4>

<p>Join us on Discord or sign up to our mailing list to find out the session for each week.</p>
<p>Typically, we do a session for a number of weeks, so that you can measure your progression. We also will try to taper sessions towards shorter distances around the major races in London.</p>

<h4 class="orange-highlight">Step two</h4>
<p><a href="https://bookings.better.org.uk/location/mile-end-park-leisure-centre/group-sessions">Book your slot</a> for the track session.</p>
<p>Over lockdown, Better introduced a <a href="https://bookings.better.org.uk/location/mile-end-park-leisure-centre/group-sessions">booking system</a> to join. This means that you can no longer just turn up - you have to book your slot in advance. They have slots every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>If you wish to join one of our sessions, please book either the 6:50, 7:00, or 7:10 slot. We will do our best to accommodate as many people into our sessions as possible.</p>

<p>If you're running your own session, but wish to join us at Track, please could we ask you to book into the 6:40 or 7:20 sessions. This will mean you're still running with us, but let's as many of the crew as possible take part in the group warm up and session briefing.</p>

<h4 class="orange-highlight">Step three</h4>
<p>Turn up at Mile End track at 7pm on a Thursday. Please note, that the entrance to the Track is on the opposite side to usual - <a href="https://w3w.co/agreed.stuck.cliff">///agreed.stuck.cliff</a> on what3words.</p>

<p>We'll share details of the session each week in our <a href="https://discord.gg/5auJxgZad9">Discord group</a>, where you can ask questions from the crew and get to know us, and we'll shortly be launching an email newsletter.</p>
