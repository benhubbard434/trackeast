<p>At Track East, our mission is to make track as accessible to as many runners as possible. We're free to join, and we don't charge membership fees. That being said, to enter Mile End track, Better Gyms charge a small fee.</p>

<p>Over lockdown, Better introduced a booking system to join. This means that you can no longer just turn up - you have to book your slot in advance. They have slots every 10 minutes. If you wish to join one of our sessions, please book either the 6:50, 7:00, or 7:10 slot. We will do our best to accommodate as many people into our sessions as possible.</p>

<p>If you're running your own session, but wish to join us at Track, please could we ask you to book into the 6:40 or 7:20 sessions. This will mean you're still running with us, but let's as many of the crew as possible take part in the group warm up and session briefing.</p>

<p>Please note, that the entrance to the Track is on the opposite side to usual.</p>

<p>We'll share details of the session each week in our Discord group, where you can ask questions from the crew and get to know us, and we'll shortly be launching an email newsletter.</p>
