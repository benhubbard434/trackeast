<h1 class="orange-highlight">400m repeats</h1>
<h4>WELCOME BACK! We are so excited to return to Mile End Stadium after so long.</h4>
<p>One of our favoruite sessions is 400m repeats. Read on to find out what this involves... if it is your first time coming to Track, please don't be shy! Let us know in advance, ask questions. We'd be happy to help.</p>
               
<p>Please read <a href="https://trackeast.co.uk/how-to-run-with-us/">this info</a> in advance of the session about Better's new system for booking Track. Please note you CANNOT just turn up at the track, like we used to.</p>
          
<h4>Background & pre-session</h4>
            <p>Most running tracks are 400m in length, so 400m repeats is a great, simple session. It's just one lap of the track for each rep, and 400m is roughly equivalent to a quarter of a mile.</p>
            <p>If you're new to track, build gradually. Perhaps start with slightly fewer repeats or a slightly longer rest between each rep. Also feel free to approach anyone else if you have questions, as we would all be happy to help. </p>
            <p>Before we start the workout, someone will lead the group in some drills. Drills are just short exercises that help us to improve our running form, and commit running movement patterns to muscle memory. </p>
            <p>After the drills, we will all run a few warm up laps together (aim to warm up for a minimum of ten minutes). The warm up should always be at a pace that feels really easy: you should be able to hold a conversation with the person running next
                to you without being too out of breath.</p>
            <p>
            </p>
<h4>The workout</h4>
            <p>Try to complete as many 400m reps as you can fit in to 40 minutes, with 60 second static recovery between each rep.</p>
            <p>Static recovery simply means that between each lap you stand still (rather than active recovery, which would be a walk or very easy jog while your heart rate comes down).</p>
            <p>To work out your target pace for one 400m rep, find your target half marathon time in the table below. If you are not sure what your target half marathon time would be, then simply aim for each 400m rep to feel like you're putting in
                a 7/10 effort.</p>
            <p>
