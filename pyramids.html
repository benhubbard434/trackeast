<h1 class="orange-highlight">Pyramids</h1>
<p>
            Pyramid sessions are a great way to add some variety to track workouts, with each successive rep building in time/distance until we reach the top of the pyramid. Each rep then decreases in time/distance until we are back to the
            starting point again. Pyramid workouts are great for training both speed and endurance, and gives us a chance to practice different paces.
        </p>
        <p>If you&#x27;re new to track, feel free to approach anyone else if you have questions about how the session works, as we would all be happy to help.</p>
        <p>
            Before we start the workout, someone will lead the group in some drills. Drills are short exercises that help us to improve our running form, and commit running movement patterns to muscle memory.
        </p>
        <h4 class="orange-highlight">Warm up:</h4>
        <p>
            After the drills, we will all run a few warm up laps together (aim to warm up for a minimum of ten minutes). The warm up should always be at a pace that feels really easy: you should be able to hold a conversation with the
            person running next to you without being too out of breath.

<h4 class="orange-highlight">Cool down:</h4>
<p>After the session, we will all run some gentle laps of the track to cool down. Please be considerate of anyone still completing their session, and stick around to offer support and encouragement.</p>
<h4 class="orange-highlight">Pace chart:</h4>
<p>This chart will give an indication of the sort of pace you might want to aim for, based on your target half marathon time. If you are unsure what your target half time is or don&#x27;t have a watch, don&#x27;t worry, as we will organise people into groups before the session starts so you&#x27;ll have someone to run with. Ultimately, the exact time for each rep does not matter too much, as long as you feel you are pushing yourself. Aim to feel like you&#x27;re giving it a 7/10 effort on each rep.</p>
