<h1 class="orange-highlight">800m repeats</h1>



<p>Most running tracks are 400m in length, so 800m repeats is a pretty simple session. It's two laps of the track for each rep. 800m is roughly equivalent to half a mile.</p>
<p>Before we start the workout, someone will lead the group in some drills. Drills are short exercises that help us to improve our running form, and commit running movement patterns to muscle memory.</p>
<p>Before the drills, we will all run a few warm-up laps together (aim to warm up for a minimum of ten minutes). The warm-up should always be at a pace that feels really easy: you should be able to hold a conversation with the person running next to you without being too out of breath.</p>
<p>If you're new to track, build gradually. Perhaps start with slightly fewer repeats or a slightly longer rest between each rep. Also, feel free to approach anyone else if you have questions, we're all happy to help.</p>
<h4>THE WORKOUT:</h4>
<p>Try to complete as many 800m reps as you can fit into 40 minutes, with a 90-second static recovery between each rep.</p>
<p>Static recovery simply means that between each lap you stand still (rather than active recovery, which would be a walk or very easy jog while your heart rate comes down).</p>
<h4 class="orange-highlight">Pace chart - 800m repeats</h4>
<p>To work out your target pace for one 400m rep, find your target half marathon time in the table below. If you are not sure what your target half marathon time would be, then simply aim for each 400m rep to feel like you're putting in a 7/10 effort.</p>
